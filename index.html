        <h2>About Vortex</h2>
        <p ><strong>Vortex parking</strong> is a <em>new</em> and <em>advanced</em> software. Founded in 2022 by Rising Bull in Hilton Head South Carolina.
            You may ask what is Vortex parking and what is its purpose. Our purpose is to help people with parking by creating parking sensors under
             parking slots and implementing screens at the entrances of parking lots. The screen will indicate and tell you how many parking spots
              spots are left in that lot and if there are none left it will relocate you to the next closest one. No more driving through a parking 
               lot looking for spots when there is none left. It feels like a waste of time doesnt it?</p>
        
        <p>Well at <em>Vortex parking</em> you wont have to worry we have you covered. There will be a mobile app so you can the parking lot before you even got 
            there if you are in a rush. Our goal here is to solve the problems many have day in and day out struggling to find parking and wasting time they 
             cant get back looking for parking spots. Ever been close to being late and you made it to the place on time but theres no parking? I think we all 
              have been there before. We plan on changing that by targeting <strong>big cities</strong> and college campuses where there are a lot of people and parking is a huge
               hassle for most.</p>
      </div>
        <p>We plan on making our sensors and screen <em>weather</em> and <em>waterproof</em> so there are no malfunctions to our technology due to the weather many may 
            experience. We at <strong>Rising bull</strong> that this is a problem millons face and we are here to change that. Our screen will be ______ size and run off of 
             _______ and our sensors will communicate with the screen at the entrance of the lot notifying it when spots are availiable. Our sensors will sit under each
              parking spot and will be able to communicate back to the screen when something is over it and when something is not. The screen will be able to display 
                everything needed.
